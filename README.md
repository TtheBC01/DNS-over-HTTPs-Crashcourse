# How to use DNS Wire Format for DNS over HTTPS queries. 

[DNS over HTTPs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8484) (DoH) allows tamper-resistant client-side interrogation of DNS records. Some DNS providers, like Cloudflare, support [JSON-structured queries](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/make-api-requests/dns-json/) which are quite simple to construct and interpret. However, most DNS providers supporting DoH require queries to be submitted in DNS Wire Format (DWF) as specified in [RFC 1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035). 

While DWF is quite efficient in terms of communication overhead, it can be difficult to piece together if you are unfamiliar with it since there are few online resources that present it in an accessible fashion. This post is a  practical crash course in constructing DWF-compatible DNS queries to leverage DoH in you client-side applications. 

## Anatomy of a DNS Message

A user client can issue queries to any DNS provider that supports DNS over HTTPS via a vanilla fetch or curl call. However, queries must be structured as a [DNS message](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-4). A DNS message has 5 fields, each of which are binary encoded in groups of 2-byte frames:

- header - 6 frames (we'll construct this once and use it over and over)
- question field - 2 frames + variable byte length Query field (we'll walk through constructing this here)
- answer field - 5 frames + variable length Name & variable length Record Data (you'll only bother with this field in the DNS provider's response payload)
- authority field - 5 frames + variable length Name & variable length Record Data (you won't likely need this field)
- additional info field - 5 frames + variable length Name & variable length Record Data (you probably won't need this field either)

To leverage DoH in a user application, you need only bother with the header (since there must AlWAYS be a header) and question fields since you will only ever be sending a query message to a DNS provider rather than participating in the DNS system itself.

## The Header Field

The header contains an arbitrary reference id (1 frame or 2 bytes), some metadata on the nature of the message, like is the message a query or a response (for our purposes it will always be a query), etc. (1 frame), the number of query entries in the query field (1 frame), the number of resource records contained in the answer field (1 frame), the number of name server resource records in the authority field (1 frame), and the number of entries in the additional info field (1 frame).

So since we will always be making a single query (not generating a response) and we want the DNS provider to recursively pursue the record, our header will likely always look like this (in hex encoded binary):

`00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00`

You can save this binary string and use it over and over for single DoH queries. 

> [!NOTE] 
> The first two bytes are arbitrary, set them to whatever you want. 

## The Query Field

Next, the query field carries the information needed to pass along a complete question to a DNS provider. 

The first `n` frames encode the domain name, called the [`QNAME`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-4.1.2), which the query is about. A domain name (like www.snickerdoodle.com) is written like this:

`3www13snickerdoodle3com0`

or in hex encoding like this:

`03 77 77 77 0d 73 6e 69 63 6b 65 72 64 6f 6f 64 6c 65 03 63 6f 6d 00`

The numbers tell the message reciever how to read the `QNAME` which is terminated with a byte of zeros. 

> [!NOTE] 
> The `QNAME` field does not need to be an integer number of frames, i.e, its length may be an odd number of bytes. There is no padding requried to fill out a full frame. 

The next frame after `QNAME`, is the type of query, called [`QTYPE`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-3.2.2). If you want to fetch a TXT record, its `TYPE` is 16 (or `00 10` as a frame of hex). So, adding this to the end of our hex encoding from above for `www.snickerdoodle.com`, you'd have:

`03 77 77 77 0d 73 6e 69 63 6b 65 72 64 6f 6f 64 6c 65 03 63 6f 6d 00 00 10`

The final frame of your query section is the class of query, called [`QCLASS`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-3.2.4). You will almost always be issuing an Internet class query, so its `CLASS` is 1 (or `00 01` as a frame of hex). Again concatenating this to the end of our hex encoded domain example gives us:

`03 77 77 77 0d 73 6e 69 63 6b 65 72 64 6f 6f 64 6c 65 03 63 6f 6d 00 00 10 00 01`

## Putting it All Together

Concatenating the header and query fields gives:

`00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 03 77 77 77 0d 73 6e 69 63 6b 65 72 64 6f 6f 64 6c 65 03 63 6f 6d 00 00 10 00 01`

and [encoding to base 64](https://cryptii.com/pipes/base64-to-binary) gives us:

`AAABAAABAAAAAAAAA3d3dw1zbmlja2VyZG9vZGxlA2NvbQAAEAAB`

With this, you can construct an DWF-compatible DoH query for a TXT record attached to www.snickerdoodle.com that is supported by most major DNS providers.

### Cloudflare

```
echo -n 'AAABAAABAAAAAAAAA3d3dw1zbmlja2VyZG9vZGxlA2NvbQAAEAAB' | base64 --decode | curl -H 'content-type: application/dns-message' --data-binary @- https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query -o - | hexdump -C
```

```
await fetch("https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?dns=AAABAAABAAAAAAAAA3d3dw1zbmlja2VyZG9vZGxlA2NvbQAAEAAB", {
  headers: {
    accept: "application/dns-message"
  }
})
```

### Google

```
await fetch("https://dns.google/dns-query?dns=AAABAAABAAAAAAAAA3d3dw1zbmlja2VyZG9vZGxlA2NvbQAAEAAB", {
  headers: {
    accept: "application/dns-message"
  }
})
```

Now, once you recieve a response, you will want to match the ID bits in the 
very first frame of the header. Next, you'll want to inspect the number 
of answers returned in the answer field; this is were you'll extract
the info you requested.
